This is a modified version of Doodle Jump. The player will be released from the top of the screen and continuously be pulled down. If the player falls to the bottom of the screen, then it is game over. However, the player can prevent this by landing on top of platforms to jump. Every time a player lands on a platform, they will bounce, and their score increases. These platforms will randomly come from the left side of the screen and move to the right of the screen.
